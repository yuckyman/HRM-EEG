## Overview

We've successfully implemented a hierarchical predictive processing framework for EEG analysis that demonstrates how the brain might use both fast local dynamics and slow contextual information for perception and prediction. **NEW: Attention mechanisms with einops optimization working on real BCI data with 74.28% accuracy!**

## How the Code Works (v5.1)

### Core Architecture

The `AttentionHierarchicalProcessor` class implements a three-tier hierarchical model with **attention mechanisms** for multi-class classification:

1. **Attention Fast RNN (Tier 1)**: Processes immediate sensory features with temporal attention
   - LSTM with 32 hidden units, 2 layers
   - **Temporal attention**: Multi-head self-attention for timepoint focus
   - Input: mean, std, delta from short windows (10ms)
   - Processes gamma oscillations and immediate dynamics
   - **Multi-class output**: 10 classes with attention weights

2. **Attention Slow RNN (Tier 2)**: Processes contextual information with temporal attention
   - LSTM with 16 hidden units, 1 layer
   - **Temporal attention**: Multi-head self-attention for context focus
   - Input: mean, std from longer windows (50ms)
   - Processes alpha/beta rhythms and slow context
   - **Multi-class output**: 10 classes with attention weights

3. **Attention Integration Network (Tier 3)**: Combines fast and slow features with cross-modal attention
   - Dense neural network with cross-modal attention
   - **Cross-modal attention**: Attention between fast and slow features
   - Learns optimal integration of multi-timescale information
   - **Multi-class classification**: 10 classes with interpretable attention

### Key Components

#### 1. Attention Architecture with Einops
```python
class AttentionFastRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=3, hidden_size=32, num_classes=10, dropout=0.1):
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.temporal_attention = TemporalAttention(hidden_size)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Handle both sequence and feature vector inputs with einops
        if x.dim() == 2:
            x = x.unsqueeze(1)  # (batch, 1, input_size)
        
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        attended, attention_weights = self.temporal_attention(lstm_out)
        return self.classifier(attended.mean(dim=1)), attention_weights
```

#### 2. Temporal Attention with Einops
```python
class TemporalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=32, num_heads=4, dropout=0.1):
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=hidden_size, num_heads=num_heads, 
            dropout=dropout, batch_first=True
        )
        self.layer_norm = nn.LayerNorm(hidden_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
        attended, weights = self.attention(x, x, x)
        # Residual connection with layer norm
        output = self.layer_norm(x + self.dropout(attended))
        return output, weights
```

#### 3. Stratified Training with Attention
```python
def train_attention_models(self, X_fast, X_slow, y, test_size=0.2, num_epochs=3):
    # Stratified split ensures all classes in both train/test
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X_fast, y, test_size=test_size, stratify=y, random_state=42
    )
    
    # Attention-aware training
    fast_output, fast_attention = self.fast_rnn(batch_fast)
    slow_output, slow_attention = self.slow_rnn(batch_slow)
    integration_output, integration_attention = self.integration_net(fast_output, slow_output)
```

## Next Steps (v5.2) - **MULTI-CHANNEL ATTENTION**

### Option A: Multi-Channel Spatial Attention ðŸ§ 
**Goal**: Extend attention to all 22 EEG channels with spatial attention

#### Spatial Attention Implementation
```python
class ChannelAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_channels=22):
        self.channel_attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_channels, num_channels // 4),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(num_channels // 4, num_channels),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: (batch_size, seq_len, num_channels)
        channel_weights = self.channel_attention(x.mean(dim=1))
        return x * channel_weights.unsqueeze(1), channel_weights
```

#### Multi-Channel RNN Extension
```python
class MultiChannelAttentionProcessor:
    def __init__(self, num_channels=22):
        self.channel_attention = ChannelAttention(num_channels)
        self.fast_rnn = AttentionFastRNN(input_size=3*num_channels)

```

#### Benefits of Multi-Channel Attention

- **Channel importance**: Identify key EEG channels for classification
- **Subject-specific patterns**: Individual channel attention patterns
- **Neuroscience alignment**: Channel attention can be validated against literature

### Option B: Advanced Attention Architectures ðŸš€
**Goal**: Implement transformer-style attention for global dependencies

#### Transformer Architecture
```python
class EEGTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_heads=8, num_layers=6):
        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(hidden_size)
        self.transformer = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(
                d_model=hidden_size,
                nhead=num_heads,
                dim_feedforward=hidden_size * 4
            ),
            num_layers=num_layers
        )
```

#### Cross-Modal Attention Enhancement

        self.fast_to_slow_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=slow_size, num_heads=4
        )
        self.slow_to_fast_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=fast_size, num_heads=4
        )
```
